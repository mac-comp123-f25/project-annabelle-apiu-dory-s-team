Check the project requirements for details what should go into this file.  Below is an outline.

## Members

- Apiu A.

## Description
Our project will take user input to draw a face with customized features. 
We will use Turtle to draw the avatar and Tkinter to make the user input.

## Inspirations Behind
There are online avatar makers where you can customize the features,
but we haven't seen any that use Turtle.

## Responsibility Plan
### Turtle drawing functions:
Face function : Annabelle

Window customization : Dory

Nose: Apiu

Eyes : Annabelle

Mouth: Dory

Hair : Apiu

Accessories : Dory

Eyebrows: Annabelle

Ears: Annabelle
### Tkinter interface:
We will all work together to program buttons for users to customize the features
using Tkinter.
